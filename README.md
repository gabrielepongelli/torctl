# torctl

Torctl tries to be a _complete_, _asynchronous_, _light_, and _easy-to-use_ Rust interface for the Tor Control Protocol.

I decided to develop it because I needed something like this for my project, but the only 2 already existing crates were incomplete and didn't fulfill some of my requirements.

My goal is to try to implement as much as possible the specifications of the protocol, which can be found [here](https://github.com/torproject/torspec/blob/main/control-spec.txt).

TODO:
- Everything

**DISCLAIMER**: this is also my first project with the Rust programming language, so do not expect too much. Anyone who wants to help me or correct me is welcome.
